=====FALCON=====
Falcon reimplements boot0, boot1, boot2, and the System Menu in C.

This version is compatible with:
boot0: *
boot1: ?
boot2: ?

=====WHY?=====
The main goal of Falcon is for me to practice decompiling C,
and using C in general. 
It also may help security researchers find vulnerabilities in boot0 and boot1
Thus allowing for a potential, say, unbrick for Wiis bricked by 4.2, or
even BootMii as boot1/boot0.
